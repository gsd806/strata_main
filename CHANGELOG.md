## v6.9.9 — 2026-09-06

Build 6.9.9 is a focused maintenance and security release with no major feature expansion.

- Split authentication, session, administrator, audit, and support responsibilities out of the HTTP composition root.
- Added correctness-focused ESLint, a single `npm run check` release gate, and informational test coverage reporting.
- Expanded trust-boundary tests for authentication, CSRF, administrator permissions, session revocation, storage parity, and Paddle webhook replay and mismatch cases.
- Documented the architecture and security-reporting process, tightened PWA maintenance checks, and removed speculative database indexes.
- Improved dialog keyboard behavior, accessible status announcements, actionable validation/conflict errors, and consistent `Saving…`, `Saved`, and `Couldn't save — Retry` states.
